The tarbal contains the following files:
lab1b-client.c: the client side program which sends commands to a sever shell and which receives output from that shell and outputs it onto the console. 

lab1b-server.c: The server side of the program. The server forks a new process which opens a shell. It then reads characters from the client side of the program, inputs that into the shell, and sends the results back to the client's console. 
		
Makefile: The standard makefile to compile the executables. Compilation is done by typing: 
	  make
my.key:
	A randomized key file used for encryption when the --encrypt option is used
