This is an implementation of an embedded system temperature sensor, which sends
temperature readings over a network to a server at lever.cs.ucla.edu. 

The files in this tarball are: 

Makefile: Compiles the executables, with various other commands.

README: What you're reading now. This contains general information about
this project.

lab4c_tcp.c: Creates a TCP connection and sends unencrypted temperature
readings to the server using port 18000.

lab4c_tls.c: Uses the openssl API to encrypt communications. It sends 
encrypted temperature readings to the server at port 19000 using 
an asymmetric key protocol.
