This is a file system checker similar to the UNIX fsck. It examines a .csv file which 
was produced from lab3a and determines whether the file system has been corrupted or not.

The following files are as follows:
README: The file you are reading now.
lab3b: The shell script to run the python script.
lab3b.py: The python script to examine a .csv file.
Makefile: This has dist and clean commands which make the tarball and clean the directory.
