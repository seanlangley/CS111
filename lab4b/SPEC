1) Use AIO functions in the MRAA library to get readings from the temperature sensor

2) Sample a temperature at a configureable rate. The rate defaults at 1/second, but can be controlled by a --period=# command line parameter.

3) Convert sensor values into a temperature. Report in Farenheit by default, but control with an optional command line parameter (--scale=C or --scale=F)

4) Create a report for each sample. The sample includes:
	a)Time of the sample in local timezone (localtime(3)), but the timezone needs to be configured first
	b) single space
	c) decimal temperature in degrees and tenths
	d) newline character

5) Write the report to stdout

6)Append the report to a logfile (created on the edison) if logging is enabled with an optional --log=filename parameter

7) Use GIPO functions in the MRAA library to sample the state of the button. When the button is pushed... 
	a) Outputs and logs a final sample with the time and the string SHUTDOWN 	(instead of a temperature)
	b) Exits
