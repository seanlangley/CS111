====================
DESCRIPTION OF FILES
====================
Makefile -- This makefile has several commands:
	default: Sets the timezone and builds the executable
	screen: Runs the Intel Edison operating system in a bash shell on my Macbook.
	kill: Terminates the screen in a proper way.
	scp: Sends files to the specific IP address of my Edison board at my home wifi.
	check: Runs the provided checking script.
	dist: Creates the tarball used for submission
	clean: Cleans up extraneous files.

lab4b.c -- Implementation of the Edison temperature sensor.
README -- The file you are reading now.


===========
LIMITATIONS
===========
For an unknown reason, the checking program fails when commands are passed through a file
rather than STDIN. The source of this error is unknown, however, the program works properly
when commands are inserted through the console in STDIN, as a normal user would use the program.
