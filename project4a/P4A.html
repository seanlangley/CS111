<H1>Project 4A<br>
Edison Bring-Up</H1>
</CENTER>

<H2>INTRODUCTION:</H2>
<P>
The venerable Arduino, while fun and useful, is an old and weak system:
<ul>
   <li> Limited CPU power greatly restricted the possible processing.</li>
   <li> Limited memory greatly restricted the type of software that could be run.</li>
   <li> The available libraries were minimal, and mostly device related.</li>
   <li> Development had to be done on another system, cross-compiled,
   	and then up-loaded and flashed onto the Arduino.</li>
</ul>
</P>
<P>
The Edison is a much more powerful platform.
It runs a full-blown Linux system:
<ul>
   <li> it hosts remote terminal access via both USB and WIFI.</li>
   <li> it has a package manager that can be used to find and download software from the internet.</li>
   <li> it can host its own complier and development tools.</li>
</ul>
Other than size and power, the biggest differences between an Edison and a desktop computer are:
<ul>
   <li> the Edison does not have a graphics adaptor or support graphical applications.</li>
   <li> the Edison has a great many programmed I/O pins that can be used to interact with
    	a wide range of sensors and actuators.</li>
</ul>
</P>
<P>
These things make it a very reasonable platform for both Embedded System, and Internet of Things projects.
</P>

<H2>RELATION TO READING AND LECTURES:</H2>
<P>
None.  
All of this work is preliminary to embedded system software development.
</P>

<H2>PROJECT OBJECTIVES:</H2>
<UL>
    <LI> ensure students have a working Edison.</LI>
    <LI> ensure that students can log into their Edison via both USB and WIFI.</LI>
    <LI> ensure that students have the ability to transfer files to/from their Edison.</LI>
    <LI> ensure students have a working Edison development environment.</LI>
    <LI> ensure students have the ability to install new packages on their Edison.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
This should be a simple matter of following simple steps.
But if you do not have communication with a working Edison 
development environment, you be unable to complete the
remaining embedded systems projects.
</p>

<H2>DELIVERABLES:</H2>
A single compressed tarball (<tt>.tar.gz</tt>) containing:
<UL>
    <LI> a selfie of you holding your assembled Edison (showing the chip).</LI>
    <LI> a screen shot from a USB terminal command session in connected to your system, gave it a name
         and configured network access.</LI>
    <LI> a screen shot from a local session in which you copy a hello world program from your laptop/desktop to your Edison.</li>
    <LI> a screen shot from a WIFI SSH session in which you build and run a trivial program.</LI>
    <LI> a screen shot from a WIFI SSH session in which you install <em>git</em> and clone a reposoitory.</LI>
    <LI> a README file containing the serial number and WiFi MAC (unless you are using a
         hard-wired ethernet connnection) MAC address of your Edison and a description
    	 of the above files.</li>
</UL>

<H2>PROJECT DESCRIPTION:</H2>
<OL type="1">
    <LI> (if you have not already done so)
    	Read the Intel
	<A href="https://software.intel.com/en-us/intel-edison-board-user-guide">tutorials on setting up your Edison.</A>.
    </LI>
    <LI> Follow the
        <a href="https://software.intel.com/en-us/assembling-intel-edison-board-with-arduino-expansion-board">
	instructions</A> 
	to assemble it, power it up and connect it (via USB) to your personal
	notebook or desktop.</li>

    <LI> Follow the 
    	<A href="http://software.intel.com/en-us/setting-up-serial-terminal-intel-edison-board">
	instructions</A> 
	to establish a USB terminal login session from your notebook/desktop to your Edison.</li>

    <LI>use the <tt>configure_edison --setup</tt> command to:
	<ul>
	   <li>	give your system a name.</li>
	   <li>	create a root password.</li>
	   <li>	enable and 
    		<A href="https://software.intel.com/en-us/connecting-your-intel-edison-board-using-wifi">
	   	configure WIFI access</a>.</li>
	</ul>
        Then run the <em>ifconfig</em> command to display the IP and MAC addresses,
        and take a screen shot.</li>

    <li> Log in to your Edison (over WIFI) via <em>ssh</em> (or <em>putty</em> or 
         other equivalent tool).</li>

    <LI> On your notebook/laptop, write a trivial C "Hello World" program.
	 Follow the
	 <A href="https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/intel-iot-platforms-file-transfer-for-linux-using-scp">
         instructions</A> to use <em>scp(1)</em> to copy that program from your notebook/desktop
         to your Edison (note: this is a <u>pull</u> from your notebook/desktop to the Edison).<br>
	 Take a screen shot (on your desktop/laptop) of the successful copy command.</li>

    <LI> Use <em>ssh(1)</em> to connect (via WIFI) to your Edison, and compile and run 
    	a simple C "Hello world." program.
        Take a screen shot of the compilation, and execution.</li>

    <LI> Follow the
         <A href="https://lasr.cs.ucla.edu/classes/edison_tutorials/opkg.pdf">
	 instructions</A>
	 to use the <strong>opkg</strong> package manager to install <em>git</em> and
	 then use <em>git</em> to <tt>clone</tt> a local copy of a repository 
	 (e.g. your own github repo).  
	 Take a screen shot of the clone command and directory listing.</LI>
</OL>
<P>
Note that you will probably find it much easier to log in and copy files to your Edison if you
set up <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SSH/OpenSSH/Keys">ssh keys</a>.
</p>

<H2>SUBMISSION:</H2>
<p>
Your tarball should have a name of the form <tt>lab4a-</tt><em>studentID</em><tt>.tar.gz</tt>.
</p>
<P>
Your <strong>README</strong> file must include lines of the form:
<ul>
	<strong>NAME:</strong> <em>your name</em><br>
	<strong>EMAIL:</strong> <em>your email</em><br>
	<strong>ID:</strong> <em>your student ID</em>
</ul>
